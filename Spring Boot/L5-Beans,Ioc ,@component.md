### 🔹 **Object Creation in Java vs Spring**

#### ✅ In Java (Manually):

```java
Car c = new Car();
```

You create the object yourself.

#### ✅ In Spring (Automatically):

- You **don't** create the object manually.
    
- You **ask Spring** (specifically, the **IoC Container**) to provide the object.
    

---

### 🔹 **What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?**

- **IoC** = You give up control of object creation to the **Spring framework**.
    
- Instead of creating objects manually, you **delegate** it to the Spring container.
    
- This is why it’s called **“inversion”** — control is flipped.
    

#### Example Analogy:

> Instead of cooking food yourself, you ask a hotel chef (Spring) to do it.

---

### 🔹 **What is IoC Container?**

- A **"box"** that holds all the **objects (beans)** of your application.
    
- You request objects from this container instead of creating them.
    
- Also known as the **ApplicationContext**.
    
- Both terms (IoC Container and ApplicationContext) are used **interchangeably**.
    

---

### 🔹 **How Does IoC Container Know What to Keep?**

- It **scans packages** (you configure the base package).
    
- Not all classes are included—only specific ones.
    

#### Criteria for Inclusion:

- The class must have a special annotation like `@Component`.
    

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent { ... }
```

---

### 🔹 **What is @Component?**

- An **annotation** that tells Spring to:
    
    - Register the class as a **Spring Bean**.
        
    - Include it in the **IoC container** during component scanning.
        
- You can use annotations on:
    
    - Classes
        
    - Interfaces
        
    - Methods
        
    - Fields
        

---

### 🔹 **What is a Bean in Spring?**

- In **Spring terminology**, a **bean = an object managed by Spring**.
    
- If a class is marked with `@Component`, Spring will create its object and keep it in the container.
    

#### Bean Lifecycle Summary:

1. You annotate the class with `@Component`.
    
2. Spring **scans the package**, finds the class.
    
3. It **creates an object** and puts it in the **IoC container**.
    
4. Later, you can **access the object** anywhere (via dependency injection).
    
5. You **don’t need** to write `new` keyword anymore.

### 📌 **Important Points Summary**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**IoC (Inversion of Control)**|Shifting the control of object creation from developer to Spring.|
|**IoC Container**|A container (box) provided by Spring that holds and manages beans (objects).|
|**ApplicationContext**|Another name for the IoC container.|
|**@Component**|Annotation used to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean.|
|**Bean**|Any object that is created and managed by the IoC container.|
|**Component Scanning**|Spring scans for classes with `@Component` (or similar annotations) and registers them.|

### ✅ What is `ApplicationContext` in Spring?

**`ApplicationContext`** is the **central interface** to the **Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container**. It is responsible for:

---

### 🧠 **In Simple Terms**

> `ApplicationContext` is the **Spring container** that holds and manages all the **beans (objects)** in a Spring application.

---

### 🔹 **Responsibilities of ApplicationContext**

1. **Bean Creation**: It creates and manages the lifecycle of all beans.
    
2. **Dependency Injection**: It injects required dependencies into beans.
    
3. **Configuration**: It reads configuration files (XML, annotations, Java config).
    
4. **Event Handling**: It supports event publication and listening.
    
5. **Internationalization**: It supports message resolution for i18n.
    
6. **Resource Management**: It loads resources like files or URLs.
    

---

### 🧾 **How It Works**

- When your Spring Boot application starts, `ApplicationContext` is automatically created.
    
- It scans your project, finds classes with annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, etc.
    
- It creates objects (beans) for those classes.
    
- It stores these beans in the container.
    
- You can **ask for a bean** by type or name, and it gives it to you.
    

---

### 🔧 Example in Spring Boot:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);

        // Get a bean from the container
        MyService service = context.getBean(MyService.class);
        service.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### 📌 Key Points

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`ApplicationContext`|Interface to the Spring container|
|`getBean()`|Used to retrieve a bean from the context|
|Created Automatically|In Spring Boot, you don’t need to create it manually|
|Types|`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`, etc. (Spring Boot uses automatically configured one)|
