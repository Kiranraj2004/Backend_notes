# üìò **Detailed Notes: Spring Boot + MongoDB ‚Äì ORM, JPA & Spring Data MongoDB**

---
## üî∂ 1. **What is ORM? (Object Relational Mapping)**

> **Definition:** ORM is a **technique** used to **map Java objects to database tables** in a relational database like MySQL.

- Example:
    
    - Java class: `User`
        
    - Database Table: `users`
        
- With ORM, you **manipulate Java objects**, and behind the scenes, SQL operations are done on the DB table.
    
- Helps developers who **don‚Äôt know SQL** to still work with databases using **Java OOP**.
    

> ORM simplifies **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations between Java and the database.

---

## üî∑ 2. **What is JPA (Java Persistence API)?**

> **JPA is not a tool or library**, it's a **specification (set of rules)** to **achieve ORM** in Java.

### üîë Breakdown:

- **Java** ‚Üí language
    
- **Persistence** ‚Üí saving data permanently
    
- **API** ‚Üí interface/set of rules
    

### ‚úîÔ∏è JPA Provides:

- **Interfaces**, **annotations**, and rules to persist Java objects.
    
- Requires a **persistence provider** (actual implementation of the rules).
    

---

## üî∏ 3. **JPA Providers / ORM Tools (Implementations of JPA)**

JPA is just a set of rules ‚Äì to use it, you need one of its implementations:

| JPA Provider    | Description             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Hibernate**   | Most popular ORM tool   |
| **EclipseLink** | Oracle‚Äôs JPA provider   |
| **OpenJPA**     | Apache's implementation |

These providers implement JPA so that Java classes can be stored in relational databases (like MySQL).

---

## üîπ 4. **What is Spring Data JPA?**

> Spring Data JPA is a **Spring-based abstraction** built on top of **JPA** to simplify ORM operations even more.

### Features:

- Reduces boilerplate code.
    
- Provides **repository interfaces**.
    
- Automatically generates queries based on **method names**.
    

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Still requires a **JPA provider** (like Hibernate) under the hood.

---

## üö´ **Why JPA is NOT Used with MongoDB**

- **JPA is designed for relational databases** with predefined schemas (tables, rows, columns).
    
- **MongoDB is NoSQL**, document-based, and **schema-less** (flexible structure).
    
- Hence, JPA and JPA providers like Hibernate are **not compatible with MongoDB**.
    

---

## ‚úÖ **What to Use Instead for MongoDB? ‚Üí Spring Data MongoDB**

### What is it?

- It‚Äôs a **Spring module** just like Spring Data JPA.
    
- Specifically designed to work with **MongoDB**.
    
- No need for traditional JPA or Hibernate.
    

### Key Benefits:

- Works natively with MongoDB‚Äôs **collections** and **documents**.
    
- Allows working with Java objects (POJOs) and automatically maps them to MongoDB documents.
    
- Fully integrates with Spring Boot ecosystem.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Interact with MongoDB in Spring Boot

There are **two main ways** to interact with MongoDB:

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**Query Method DSL**|You create repository methods using specific naming conventions (e.g., `findByName()`) and Spring generates the queries for you.|
|**Criteria API**|A programmatic way to build dynamic queries. More flexible but more complex.|

### Example (Query Method DSL):

```java
List<User> findByAgeGreaterThan(int age);
```

Spring interprets this method name and converts it into a MongoDB query automatically.

## üèÅ Summary

|Concept|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**ORM**|Mapping Java classes to DB tables|
|**JPA**|Specification for ORM in Java|
|**Hibernate / EclipseLink**|JPA implementations (for relational DBs)|
|**Spring Data JPA**|Abstraction layer for JPA in Spring|
|**MongoDB**|NoSQL database (uses collections/documents)|
|**Spring Data MongoDB**|Spring integration with MongoDB (alternative to JPA for NoSQL)|
