## üß† **Problem Statement**

In the journaling app, when we save or delete a journal entry, it should reflect both:

- In the **JournalEntries** collection.
    
- Inside the corresponding **User's journal list**.
    

### ‚ùó Issue

If saving a journal entry to `JournalEntries` succeeds, but saving it to the `User` fails, we end up with an **inconsistent state**:

- The entry is saved in the `JournalEntries` collection.
    
- But not associated with the user.
    

This leads to **orphaned entries** that belong to no user.

---

## ‚úÖ **Ideal Solution: Use Transactions**

We want **all operations to succeed or all to fail** ‚Äî this is where **transactions** come in.

---

## üîÑ **Step-by-Step Fix using Transactions in Spring Boot with MongoDB**

### üîπ Step 1: Annotate the method with `@Transactional`

```java
@Transactional
public void saveEntry(JournalEntry entry, String username) {
    // Save journal entry and update user's journal list
}
```

This ensures the **method is treated as a single transaction** ‚Äî all DB operations inside it will either complete or rollback together.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Enable Transaction Management

In the main application or a config class:

```java
@EnableTransactionManagement
@Configuration
public class TransactionConfig {
    ...
}
```

This enables Spring Boot to **track and manage transactions** across your service methods.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Configure a Bean for `PlatformTransactionManager`

This tells Spring **how to handle MongoDB transactions** behind the scenes:

```java
@Bean
public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(MongoDatabaseFactory dbFactory) {
    return new MongoTransactionManager(dbFactory);
}
```

- `MongoDatabaseFactory` is used to **connect to MongoDB**.
    
- `MongoTransactionManager` is the actual class that **manages** begin/commit/rollback.
    

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exception Handling

Make sure to **throw exceptions** on failure inside a try-catch block. If you just catch and swallow the exception, Spring won‚Äôt rollback the transaction.

```java
try {
    // some DB operations
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    throw new RuntimeException("Transaction failed", e); // Trigger rollback
}
```

---

## üí• Real Problem: Local MongoDB doesn't support transactions

When running MongoDB **locally without replica sets**, you‚Äôll get this error:

> `Transaction members are only allowed on a replica set member`

This means transactions only work if MongoDB is configured as a **replica set** (even locally).

---

## üåê Solution: Use MongoDB Atlas

Since setting up local replica sets is tedious, the video suggests:

1. Create a **free MongoDB Atlas account**.
    
2. Connect Spring Boot to **MongoDB Atlas**.
    
3. Atlas comes with **replica sets by default**, so transactions will work properly.
    

In `application.properties`, you‚Äôll update:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
```

## üßæ Summary

|Topic|Details|
|---|---|
|Problem|Inconsistent save if one part fails|
|Fix|Use `@Transactional` to group DB operations|
|Required Config|`@EnableTransactionManagement`, custom `PlatformTransactionManager` bean|
|Exception Handling|Must **throw** exceptions to trigger rollback|
|MongoDB Limitation|Transactions need **replica sets**|
|Solution|Use **MongoDB Atlas** for built-in replica sets|

---

## üß∞ Bonus: `PlatformTransactionManager` Flow

- **Interface**: `PlatformTransactionManager`
    
- **Implementation**: `MongoTransactionManager`
    
- **Needs**: `MongoDatabaseFactory` to interact with MongoDB
    
- Used by Spring to:
    
    - Begin transactions
        
    - Commit if successful
        
    - Rollback if any exception

### In Spring Boot, we create **Beans** so that Spring can manage the lifecycle and dependencies of objects **automatically** using its **Dependency Injection (DI)** container.


---

## üß† Why We Create Beans (in general):

When you write something like:

```java
@Bean
public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(MongoDatabaseFactory dbFactory) {
    return new MongoTransactionManager(dbFactory);
}
```

You're telling Spring:

> "Hey Spring, please create this object (`MongoTransactionManager`) and manage it for me. Inject it wherever it's needed."

---

## ‚úÖ Specific to Your Case: Transaction Manager Bean

### Why we need this Bean:

Spring **doesn‚Äôt know automatically** which `PlatformTransactionManager` to use for MongoDB.

- Spring supports transactions for many databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
    
- To use transactions in MongoDB, we need to **tell Spring**:
    
    - Use `MongoTransactionManager`
        
    - Use it with the current `MongoDatabaseFactory`
        

So we create this bean manually:

```java
@Bean
public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(MongoDatabaseFactory dbFactory) {
    return new MongoTransactionManager(dbFactory);
}
```

---

## üîÑ What happens after we define this Bean:

1. Spring **calls this method** at startup.
    
2. It **creates and registers** `MongoTransactionManager` as a Bean in the Spring context.
    
3. When Spring sees `@Transactional` on a method:
    
    - It looks for a `PlatformTransactionManager` bean.
        
    - It uses the one we defined (`MongoTransactionManager`) to manage the transaction.
        

---

## üß™ Without the Bean?

If you **don‚Äôt define this bean**, Spring will **not know how to handle `@Transactional` for MongoDB**, and you‚Äôll get an error like:

```
No qualifying bean of type 'PlatformTransactionManager' available
```
