### ‚úÖ Recap: Why Customize `configure(HttpSecurity http)`?

- By default, all endpoints are secured using **HTTP Basic Authentication** with a single in-memory user.
    
- We want to:
    
    - Allow **public endpoints** like `/hello` without authentication.
        
    - Protect other endpoints.
        
    - Customize behavior like login forms, logout functionality, and session handling.

## üîπ Understanding `HttpSecurity` in `configure()` Method

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/hello").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .formLogin()
        .and()
        .logout();
}
```

### üîç Explanation of Chained Methods:

1. **`authorizeRequests()`**
    
    - Starts request authorization process.
        
    - Tells Spring Security: _‚ÄúWe are defining security rules now.‚Äù_
        
2. **`antMatchers("/hello").permitAll()`**
    
    - Permits access to `/hello` endpoint without authentication.
        
3. **`anyRequest().authenticated()`**
    
    - Any request other than `/hello` must be authenticated.
        
4. **`formLogin()`**
    
    - Enables Spring Security's **default login form**.
        
    - If an unauthenticated user tries to access a secured endpoint, they are redirected to `/login` (default).
        
5. **`logout()`**
    
    - Enables logout handling by default.
        
    - A `POST` request to `/logout` will invalidate the session.
        
6. **`.and()`**
    
    - Used for chaining additional configuration blocks.
    - redirect to http verifications

### üß† Understanding `HttpSecurity` Object

- `HttpSecurity` allows you to configure:
    
    - **What endpoints** require authentication.
        
    - **Which endpoints** are public.
        
    - **Login/logout** behavior.
        
    - **Session and CSRF** configuration.
        
- Similar to how we manipulate objects like `Student student = new Student()`, here `http` is the object.
    

---

### üî∏ Method Chaining in Spring Security

- Configuration is often written using **method chaining** for readability.
    

```java
http
    .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/hello").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    .and()
    .formLogin()
    .and()
    .logout();
```

- Each method returns a configuration object allowing another configuration method to follow.
    

---

## üîê Login Flow (With `formLogin()`)

- If a request is made to a **secured endpoint** without credentials:
    
    - User is **redirected** to Spring Security's **default login form** at `/login`.
        
- Spring Security uses its **own controller** to serve this form.
    
- If you build a **custom login page**, you can configure its path explicitly.
    

---

## üîê Logout Handling (With `logout()`)

- Default logout behavior is enabled by `.logout()`.
    
- A `POST` request to `/logout`:
    
    - Invalidates the session.
        
    - Removes cookies (like session ID).
        
    - Logs the user out of the application.

## üßæ Stateless vs Stateful Authentication

|Feature|Stateless (Basic Auth)|Stateful (Form Login with Session)|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory of user between requests**|‚ùå No (each request must send credentials)|‚úÖ Yes (stored in session)|
|**Authorization Header needed**|‚úÖ Required every time|‚ùå Only needed at login|
|**Performance**|Lower due to repeated verification|Better after login|
|**Session**|Not created|Created (session ID stored in cookie)|
|**Use case**|REST APIs (microservices)|Traditional web applications|

---

### üß† What is a Session?

- A **session** stores user authentication details after login.
    
- Managed by Spring Security using a **Session ID Cookie**.
    
- This session ID:
    
    - Is sent to the client after login.
        
    - Is sent back in every subsequent request to maintain the session.
        
- Example:
    
    - You log in ‚Üí Session created ‚Üí Browser receives `JSESSIONID` cookie.
        
    - Future requests send this cookie ‚Üí Server recognizes you.
        

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Basic Authentication

- **Basic Auth is stateless by design**:
    
    - No session or memory of user across requests.
        
    - Every request must send the `Authorization` header again.
        

> üß† Although technically possible, combining **Basic Auth with sessions** is uncommon and requires custom setup.

---

## üîë `Remember-Me` Functionality

- Enables **persistent login** across sessions.
    
- Even after session timeout, user remains authenticated via a **token** stored in a persistent cookie.
    
- Used for "Remember me on this device" type functionality.
    

---

## ‚ùå Current Application Issues

- Currently, only one default user (`user`) is configured.
    
- All endpoints are visible to this one user, including:
    
    - Journal entries of all users (Ram, Shyam, etc.)
        

### ‚úÖ Problem Summary:

- Even if `Ram` logs in, he can see entries of `Shyam` ‚Äî **this is wrong**.
    
- The system needs to:
    
    - Authenticate users.
        
    - Authorize access to resources based on user identity and roles.
        
    - Store hashed passwords instead of plain text (insecure).
        

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps to Implement

1. **Create multiple users with different roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN)**
    
2. **Restrict access to endpoints based on role**
    
    - e.g., only `Ram` can access `Ram`'s journals.
        
3. **Store user data (including passwords) in the database**
    
4. **Hash passwords using BCrypt or other encoders**
    
5. **Set up JWT (for APIs) or use proper session management (for web apps)**
