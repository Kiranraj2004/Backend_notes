### ✅ Key Point:

- The main class (e.g., `MyFirstProjectApplication.java`) is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
    
- It contains the `main()` method, which starts the app via the **Spring Boot framework**.
    

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyFirstProjectApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyFirstProjectApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

> To run the application, **right-click this class and run** it — this boots the Spring container.

---

## 🔹 @SpringBootApplication Annotation 

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a combination of three key Spring annotations:

1. `@Configuration` – Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
    
2. `@EnableAutoConfiguration` – Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration.
    
3. `@ComponentScan` – Scans the base package for components (like `@Component`, `@Controller`, etc.)
    

---

## 🔹 Component Scanning Explained

Spring will **only scan components** inside the **base package** — the package where the main application class resides.

### 📌 Example:

Assuming the base package is `com.codedigest.myfirstproject`, then:

```java
// File: src/main/java/com/codedigest/myfirstproject/Car.java
@Component
public class Car {
    // Some logic
}
```

✅ This **will be scanned**.

```java
// File: src/main/java/com/codedigest/something/Dog.java
@Component
public class Dog {
    public String fun() {
        return "This is Dog Fun!";
    }
}
```

🚫 This **will NOT be scanned** unless you:

- Move it to a sub-package of the base package.
    
- Or, explicitly configure additional component scan paths.
    

---

## 🔹 Problem Demo with Output 

### Code:

```java
@RestController
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Dog dog;

    @GetMapping("/dog")
    public String getDogFun() {
        return dog.fun();
    }
}
```

If `Dog` is in an **external package**, and not scanned, Spring will fail to inject it.

### ❌ Output (Console Error):

```
Error creating bean with name 'car':
Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field 'dog';
No qualifying bean of type 'com.codedigest.something.Dog' available
```

---

## 🔹 Fixing the Issue

**Solution:** Move `Dog` to the base package (e.g., `com.codedigest.myfirstproject`) or a sub-package.

### Folder Structure:

```
src/main/java/
└── com/codedigest/myfirstproject/
    ├── MyFirstProjectApplication.java
    ├── Car.java
    └── Dog.java
```

### Updated Working Code:

**Dog.java**

```java
package com.codedigest.myfirstproject;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Dog {
    public String fun() {
        return "Dog is having fun!";
    }
}
```

**Car.java**

```java
package com.codedigest.myfirstproject;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

@RestController
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Dog dog;

    @GetMapping("/dog")
    public String getDogFun() {
        return dog.fun();
    }
}
```

**MyFirstProjectApplication.java**

```java
package com.codedigest.myfirstproject;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyFirstProjectApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyFirstProjectApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Output (When Running and Accessing `localhost:8080/dog`)

```
Dog is having fun!
```

---

## 🔹 RestController is a Specialized Component

The `@RestController` annotation:

- Combines `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`
    
- Indicates the class is a web controller
    
- Returns data (not views) directly from methods
    

---

## ✅ Summary

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`@SpringBootApplication`|Combines 3 annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`|
|Component Scanning|Only within the base package (or sub-packages) unless configured otherwise|
|`@Component`|Marks a class to be managed by Spring|
|`@RestController`|Specialized component that handles HTTP requests and returns JSON/text|
|`@Autowired`|Automatically injects the required bean|
|Error Cause|Spring can’t find `@Component` if it’s outside the scanned package|
|Fix|Move classes inside the base package or add custom scan path|




### 📌 Manual Object Creation (Old Way - Not Recommended)

```java
Dog dog = new Dog();
```

This is **manual instantiation** of an object. It's not recommended in Spring-based applications because:

- It bypasses Spring's **Inversion of Control (IoC)** container.
    
- The object is not managed by Spring, so you **lose features** like AOP, transaction management, proxying, etc.
    

---

### ✅ Spring’s Way — **Using `@Autowired`**

```java
@Autowired
private Dog dog;
```

### 🔍 What This Does:

- You're telling **Spring: "Please inject an instance of `Dog` into this field."**
    
- Spring will **search its container** (IoC container) for a bean of type `Dog`.
    
- If found, it will inject it **automatically** — no need to create the object manually.
    

### 📌 Pre-requisites for Injection:

1. `Dog` must be annotated with `@Component` (or similar stereotype annotations).
    
2. `Dog` must be in the **component-scanned package** (usually same or sub-package of main class).
    

---

## 💡 Concept: **IoC (Inversion of Control)**

Instead of the developer **creating objects**, Spring does that for you and **injects dependencies** where needed.

This is why you can say:

```java
@Autowired
private Dog dog;
```

And Spring gives you the object.

---

## 🔧 Full Example

### 🐾 Dog.java

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Dog {
    public String fun() {
        return "Dog is having fun!";
    }
}
```

### 🚗 Car.java

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Dog dog;

    @GetMapping("/dog")
    public String getDogFun() {
        return dog.fun();
    }
}
```

### 🚀 Output

Visit: `http://localhost:8080/dog`  
Response:

```
Dog is having fun!
```

# 🧾 What is `@RestController` in Simple Words?

In **Spring Boot**, `@RestController` is a **special annotation** that does two important things:

---

### ✅ 1. It Tells Spring: "This Class is a Controller"

Just like a teacher in a classroom, this class will **receive and handle web requests** like:

- GET `/users`
    
- POST `/journal`
    
- DELETE `/notes/5`
    

---

### ✅ 2. It Automatically Returns Data as JSON

Normally, if you return a `String` or `Object`, Spring might try to find a view (like an HTML file).  
But with `@RestController`, Spring automatically says:

> "Oh! You want to return **data**, not a webpage. I’ll convert it to **JSON** for you."

---

### 🔁 It’s Like Combining Two Annotations:

```java
// Equivalent to:
@Controller
@ResponseBody
```

So instead of writing both, you just use:

```java
@RestController
```

---

### 🧠 Simple Example:

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

When you go to: `http://localhost:8080/hello`  
✅ You will see: `Hello, Spring Boot!` — as a raw response, **not an HTML page**.

---

### 🔚 In Summary:

|Feature|What it does|
|---|---|
|`@RestController`|Handles web requests & returns **data** (usually JSON)|
|Used for|Building **RESTful APIs** in Spring Boot|
|Replaces|`@Controller + @ResponseBody`|
